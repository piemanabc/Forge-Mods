# Welcome!

This repository is in place to make managing the mods and any configs that are needed to connect to this server a little easier! I realise that not everyone knows how to use GitHub, so I've created this Readme. Steps are outlined below:

1. [Download mods](#download-mods)
2. [Install forge](#install-forge)
3. [Install mods](install-mods)
4. [Connect and play!](#connect-and-play)

## Download Mods
If you're new to Github, it might a it overstimulating. All you need to know is to hit the `<> Code` Button, then `Download ZIP`:

This will give you a Copy of the entire repository, which contains all the mods needed to join.

## Install forge
For Brevities' sake, I'll assume you've done this before. The server is currently running on **[Minecraft Java 1.20.1](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download)**. So you'll need to have this version downloaded (You can do this by launching it once).

You can get the forge installer for this version here:
https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/

---

## Install-mods

To get these installed you'll want to copy the content of the `/mods/` directory and place it into your mods folder. If you're not sure where this is, the default location on windows systems is:
```

C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods

```
You'll need to replace `[username]` with your account's name on your PC.

---

## Connect and play.
Now your mods are installed, you'll want to launch the game. If you're running into errors when launching ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Figure it out or cope. The internet and ChatGPT are your friends here


Once you've gotten into the Minecraft title screen you can connect through the domain name for the server, which is:
```

f.mrr.nz

```
It should look something like this:
